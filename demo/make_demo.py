Build DEMO.COM -- the bundled demonstration program.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The app has to do something on a device with no games on it. That is both a
usability point (a launcher showing an empty list looks broken) and an App
Store one: a review of an emulator with no content to run is a review of a
blank screen, and reviews like that fail.

The obvious fix -- ship a well-known shareware episode -- carries licensing and
trademark risk we do not need. So the demo is ours: a few hundred bytes of
16-bit x86 that exercises the parts of the emulator a reviewer can see working
(DOS text output, INT 21h, INT 16h keyboard, and a VGA mode 13h animation
synchronised to the retrace). No third-party code, nothing to license.

WHY A PYTHON ASSEMBLER
----------------------
There is no assembler in the build environment, and committing a binary blob
with no source is exactly the sort of thing nobody can later audit or change.
This script IS the source: the byte encodings are written out explicitly and
the two-pass label resolution below removes the hand-arithmetic that makes
hand-assembly unreliable.

Usage:  python3 make_demo.py [output.com] [--name DOSDeck]
